                <p>Hi, I’m Jin &mdash; a creator and builder passionate about bringing ideas to life. My journey has taken me from investment banking to managing operations at a Series C startup, and eventually founding two D2C brands. I hold a business degree with a fine arts minor from UPENN. I thrive at the intersection of business and creativity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Right now, I’m exploring where curiosity leads me, constantly seeking meaningful projects and collaborations. If you’d like to work together, share ideas, or just have a chat, feel free to email or DM me. Thanks for stopping by—I’d love to connect!</p>
